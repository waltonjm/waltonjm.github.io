                <h4>Jacqueline Walton</h4>
                <p>
                    Jacqueline Walton is the Founder/CEO of wigwagapp, Inc. An iOS mobile application, wigwag&reg; is set to launch soon as a social lifestyle food avoidance management application designed to assist users to live better. Wigwag is Ms. Walton's second startup.
                    She successfully exited her first company in 2016, a government contracting company she founded in 2005. She took the company from one employee to 450 employees with an estimated 30M in revenue. As the President/CEO, she was responsible
                    for overseeing the day-to-day management including contract and subcontract management while fostering a culture of integrity throughout the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to founding Marton, Ms. Walton held a federal civil servant position with the U.S. Navy as the Field Portable Analytical Equipment Manager for the Forward Deployed Preventive Medicine Units and later as a Subject Matter Expert providing real-time
                    specialized analytical services. She also served as a Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) for research and development focused contracts. Ms. Walton garnered her technical expertise during her active-duty service
                    in the U.S. Navy. She was one of a few naval officers that held duel subspecialty codes. In her case, as an Industrial Hygiene Officer with a secondary subspecialty code as an Environmental Health Officer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an industrial hygienist she addressed health and safety issues, reducing injury and disease risks among Navy and Marine Corps personnel. She concentrated her efforts in the chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE)
                    arena. As a result, through the course of her naval career she was selected to work on special projects such as Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) panels and Active Concept Technology Demonstrations (ACTDs). She also stood up
                    a Joint Preventive Medicine Equipment Sub-Group chartered under the Joint Environmental Surveillance Working Group (JESWG) and was part of a select team that stood up the U.S. Navy's Forward Deployed Preventative Medicine Units (FDPMUs).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ms. Walton completed her M.S. in Community Health at Old Dominion University (ODU) during her active-duty time. Prior to enlisting in the U.S. Navy, Ms. Walton received her B.S. in Environmental Health from ODU where she was elected by her peers to serve
                    as the President of the ODU Student National Environmental Health Association (SNEHA) leading fundraising and community service activities. During this time, she was selected to serve as an Environmental Health Officer (Sanitarian)
                    under a highly competitive externship program through the United States Public Health Service (USPHS). Upon graduating from ODU, Ms. Walton completed a lateral transfer from the USPHS to the U.S. Navy. To give back to the college that
                    spurred her successful career, Ms. Walton established the ODU Marton Technologies Scholarship in honor of A.J. English. Professor English served as the Director of Environmental Health Programs and retired in 2015.
